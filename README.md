- Room Management: Track room availability and statuses (occupied, vacant, or under maintenance).
- Secure Checkout Process: Finalize patient discharge, update room statuses, and generate bills.
- Extensibility: Easy-to-extend framework for adding new modules or features.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Frontend: Windows Forms in C#
- Backend: SQL Server
- Architecture: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Testing Framework: NUnit
